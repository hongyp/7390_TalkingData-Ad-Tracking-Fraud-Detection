For the dataset, we have the train.csv for the training. After training, using the test.csv for our prediction. 
But for our model, we have to create new features for our prediction. So, we translated this test.csv to test_small_all_features.csv that has 1,000,000 rows size with all needed columns (features). 
Due to this small size (our computers are not powerful enough to run all data), for our second part of columns, we have 100% accuracy and it also caused 100% accuracy of the all-featured prediction, which maybe overfitted. If we can run all of the data, our output the prediction can be more reliable.
In conclusion, our new created featured successfully increase the prediction.
